Computational Fluid Dynamics. I've created this  repository to aid the forthcoming Computational Researchers in Heat transfer and Fluid Mechanics.
But to be precise, computational schemes just converts the partial differential equation into algebraic form and solve using any Numerical scheme. This is the major solution methodology followed across branches. 
So, any physics has the same type of equation format(depending on elliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic), where we solve the laplacian or Poisson equations. So, irrespective of Thermo-Fluid Engineers, I suggest all branches to follow this thread.
